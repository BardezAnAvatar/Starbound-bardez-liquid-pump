It wires output similar to power networks, and its metadata contains the amount of liquid detected, which can be connected to and emitted to the display.\n    [*][b]Liquid Pressure Display[/b] (`bardez_liquid_compression_display`), a series of digital displays supporting digits up to 99,999 of the amount of liquid detected in the 1x1 block in front of a connected [b]Liquid Pressure Gauge[/b]. This tells you how compressed a liquid in an area is!\n     [list]Comes in various display sizes:\n      [list]\n       [*] 1x1, 1 digit (`bardez_liquid_compression_display_1x1`)\n       [*] 1x2, 2 digits (`bardez_liquid_compression_display_1x2`)\n       [*] 1x3, 3 digits (`bardez_liquid_compression_display`) NOTE: keeping item name same for backwards compatibility for old subscribers\n       [*] 1x4, 4 digits (`bardez_liquid_compression_display_1x4`)\n       [*] 1x5, 5 digits (`bardez_liquid_compression_display_1x5`)\n      [/list]\n     [/list]\n   [*][b]Liquid Capturing Drain[/b] (`bardez_liquid_drain`), which is both a drain and a container. It is a wirable object compatible with item transfer networks, too! It will drain liquid in front of it when `on` and move that liquid into its container inventory.\n   [*][b]Quantum Liquid Multiplier[/b] (`bardez_liquid_compressor`), a wirable object that when `on`, will take a pressurized liquid in front of it an emit it back out on the side, with a slight multiplier. While this potentially makes it a cheat item, it is balanced with existing Frackin' Universe items and crafting requirements, so it isn't [i]too[/i] OP IMO. It is a neat alternative to the liquid drip mechanics of infinite X liquids in the base game.\n  [/list]\n [*]Integrates with the Frackin' Universe research tree\n  [list]\n   [*]Adds the [b]Quantum Liquid Multiplier[/b] to the madness tree\n   [*]Adds the rest to the electronics tree\n  [/list]\n[/list]\n\nCheck out the pump in action:[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BardezAnAvatar/Starbound-bardez-liquid-pump/main/assets/drain-in-action.gif[/img]\n\n\nBoring Stuff:\n[url=https://github.com/BardezAnAvatar/Starbound-bardez-liquid-pump]Source on GitHub[/url]\n\n\n[b]Attributions[/b]: This mod utilizes the Item Transfer Network code from Frackin' Universe (FU), as well as a derivitive of FU's power sensor display (I think; this mod was scripted by me 2 years ago for personal use), all written by their various authors/respective contributors/etc.",
